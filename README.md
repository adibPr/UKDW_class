This repo contains Jupyter Notebook for all classes/seminars that I gave.

This project was created for educational purposes only.

You can use it, fork it as much as you want.

But you need to install [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/), [python version 3](https://www.python.org/) and it's module dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
